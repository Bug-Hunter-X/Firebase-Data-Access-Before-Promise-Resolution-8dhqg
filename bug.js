The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you attempt to access a property of a document snapshot before the promise from `get()` or `onSnapshot()` resolves.  This commonly happens when you try to access data synchronously, expecting it to be available immediately.  For example, if you call `docRef.get().then(...)` but try to access data before the `.then` block executes, you'll get an error indicating that the data isn't available yet.
